    "# Data Split Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook splits the dataset into three parts before performing any detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to set up a clear and reliable starting point for building and testing the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Initial Check\n",
    "\n",
    "Before splitting, a quick check of the dataset was done:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dataset contains around 15,000 rows, which is small enough to work with directly.\n",
    "* A light inspection of the date and time column showed that timestamps are available and appear to be sequential.\n",
    "\n",
    "This justifies a time-aware split and helps avoid bias or data leakage before deeper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Split Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is divided as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Train (75%)**\n",
    "  Used for model training and feature building. This set reflects typical user behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Validation (15%)**\n",
    "  Used to tune model settings (like contamination rate or dimensionality reduction) and check model stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Holdout Test (10%)**\n",
    "  Used for final evaluation. This data is kept separate to assess model performance on truly unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time-Aware Consideration\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the dataset includes a timestamp (_event date and time_) and the entries appear sequential, a time-based split will be used to preserve the natural order of events:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train on the earliest 75%\n",
    "* Validate on the next 15%\n",
    "* Test on the most recent 10%\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Time-Aware Splitting Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Bot behavior can change over time, so using a random split might mix old and new patterns. That could make the model appear more accurate than it truly is.\n",
    "\n",
    "A time-based split simulates how the model would perform in a real-world scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It learns from past behavior\n",
    "* Then it is tested on future, unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps evaluate how well the model adapts to new patterns or changes in traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "A chronological 75-15-10 split is used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid mixing past and future data\n",
    "* Maintain time order\n",
    "* Prepare the model for real-world use cases\n"
